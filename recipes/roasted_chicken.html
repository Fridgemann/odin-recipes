    </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken</strong>: This recipe starts with a 3-pound whole chicken. If your bird is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe</li>
        
        <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: This roasted chicken is simply seasoned with salt, black pepper, and onion powder.
        
        </li>
        
        <li><strong>Butter</strong>: Butter locks in moisture and gives the seasonings something to adhere to.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Celery</strong>: Stuff the chicken cavity with celery for subtle vegetal flavor. Plus, the celery will release even more moisture as the chicken cooks.
        </li>
